## Q's: 
- What is your background? 

strong background in accessibility, [see medium bio](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/@zersiax), as well as computer science student, musician, linguist as a hobby
- Why are you interested in tech?

Tech has been a part of my life ever since I can remember. Making my career out of it was therefore an easy choice.

- Why is it important for others to be interested in accessibility?

In 2016 you honestly can't get away with NOT knowing or caring about it any more. More and more legislation is being created that mandates accessibility anyway, might as well get with the program. It's not that hard if you keep it in mind from the get go and you help others out as well as spare yourself a huge amount of grief later down the line. ;)

  - What are the numbers for people that use assistive  tech? 

Honestly don't know. It varies, but expect the numbers to be quite a bit higher than you might think. I'm talking millions across the globe.
 
- Powerdime, what is it?

Powerdime is my pet project. I want to build a platform to bring disabled people together and have them learn from each other , rather than from training programs that might not exist in their environment or be given by incompetent people who can't empathize with their situation. More details, indigogo campaign etc. coming soon.
